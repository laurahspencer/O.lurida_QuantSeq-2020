## Any genes that are Diff. Exp. between cohorts the same? 

```{r}
# Genes diff expressed across all populations, all comparisons 
Reduce(intersect, list(rownames(diffex.larvae.DBFB),
                       rownames(diffex.larvae.DBOB1),
                       rownames(diffex.larvae.DBOB2),
                       rownames(diffex.larvae.FBOB1),
                       rownames(diffex.larvae.FBOB2)))


```

### Plot the gene that's diff across all pops 

```{r}
a <-  plotCounts(dds.larvae.DESeq, gene="OLUR_00023802", intgroup=c("population"), returnData = TRUE)

ggplot(a %>% rownames_to_column("sample"),
       aes(x=population, y=count, color=population, label=sample)) +
  geom_point(position=position_jitter(w = 0.1,h = 0)) +
    geom_text() +
    theme_bw() +
    ggtitle("OLUR_00023802") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```
